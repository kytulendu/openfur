v0.1 Moving jaw test video

This is my first fursuit head and first 3D printable object that I have design. The design is a semi-realistic skull cat mask, suitable for fursuit head, Halloween costume or cosplay. Intended as a base to modify into my fursona's fursuit head in future.

Currently in beta version.

Using "Lion - Panthera leo By Lily Wilson" model as base, "3D human head scan by celer" model as head dimension reference and "Jaw Hinge by gootartsis" for the jaw hinge parts. Sculpt using Blender.

**Print Settings**

I use Cura to slice the model and print with Ender-5 Plus. You may have to re-mesh the mesh before slice the model.

Due to the fursuit head base have been design using my head size in mind, you will have to adjust/modify the model according to your head dimension before print.

- Scale: Scale to fit your head
- Infill Density: 20-30%
- Support: Generate Support
- Build Plate Adhesion Type: Brim or Raft (I use Raft because the print keep deattach from the hot-bed in my case)

Printing tips: When using pause print function, you must set the hot-bed at the print temperature (in my case using PLA, 60c) else the print will cool down and will deattached from the hot-bed.
